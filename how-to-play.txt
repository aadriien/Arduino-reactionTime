1.) — Plug the wire into the USB port of the computer, and select Arduino Uno as the port under the “Tools” section.

2.) — Copy & paste the full code, then verify and upload it.

3.) — Open the serial monitor.

4.) — The game will begin with a song.

5.) — You will then be asked (via the serial monitor) whether you would like to move between games using the serial monitor or using interactive inputs. Select your choice.

6.) — The Lightspeed game will begin with 1 of the 5 LEDs flashing to signal that it has been selected.

7.) — Press on the colored button that corresponds to the chosen LED when the LED is hit by the flashing Knight Rider sequence.

8.) — If you press an incorrect button, you will hear unpleasant music to signal your error.

9.) — If 5 mistakes are made, then the game will end, and you will have the choice to start everything over from the beginning.

10.) — Once you have pressed the correct button at the correct time, the LED will flash, and you will hear celebratory music.

11.) — Your score for Lightspeed will then be displayed on the LEDs, where you lose a point (out of 5 total) for each mistake.

12.) — If you won the game on your first attempt, an additional round of the triumphant music will play.

13.) — You will then be prompted to move to the next game. If you had selected to use the serial monitor earlier, you can make your choice using your computer keyboard. If you had instead opted for interactive inputs, press any of the 5 buttons to continue.

14.) — The DJ Memory game will begin with a random musical note being played, and an LED will light up.

15.) — You must wave your hand over the photoresistor that corresponds to the LED that was lit, so as to replicate the note.

16.) — If successful, your good work will be celebrated with music, and you will need to then repeat this process for increasingly longer sequences of musical notes.

17.) — If at any point you are incorrect in mimicking the sequence, then you will hear unpleasant music to signal your error, the game will end, and you will have the choice to start everything over from the beginning.

18.) — If you manage to correctly copy all 5 sequences, then you will have won the game.

19.) — Your score for DJ Memory will be displayed on the LEDs, where each successful sequence / level reached will have earned you an additional point.

20.) — If you made it through all 5 levels, an additional round of the triumphant music will play.

21.) — At the end of DJ Memory, you will be given the choice to restart all games from the beginning. Utilize either the serial monitor or any of the 5 buttons (based on your earlier choice of input) to make your decision.
